In order to use the Web-Crawler you must first create a run configuration with the following arguments:
"[depth] [target language tag] [translation boolean] [webpage 1 to crawl] [webpage 2 to crawl] ..."


[depth] ... the depth of the crawler
[target language tag] ... the target language tag (all supported language tags of the DeepL API i.e.: en-GB, de, hu, ...)
[translation boolean] ... enables translation if set to "true", every other String disables it
[webpage 1 to crawl] ... the url of the first webpage you would like to crawl
[webpage 2 to crawl] ... the url of the second webpage you would like to crawl
... you may enter multiple urls
