<br>[depth] ... the depth of the crawler
<br>[target language tag] ... the target language tag (all supported language tags of the DeepL API i.e.: en-GB, de, hu, ...)

<br>[webpage 1 to crawl] ... the url of the first webpage you would like to crawl
<br>[webpage 2 to crawl] ... the url of the second webpage you would like to crawl
<br>... you may enter multiple urls
